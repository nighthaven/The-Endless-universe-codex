### Commit organization and contributions

Currently, I am the only contributor to this repository.

The naming convention for git commits follows this pattern:
`[concerned] action: comment`

`[concerned]` -> indicates the part of the project affected by the commit, such as `[backend]` or `[frontend]` (React in this case).
`action` -> describes the type of change being made, such as `add`, `fix`, or `update`.

Example: `(EC-00001)[API] feat: new API endpoint for user authentication`.
