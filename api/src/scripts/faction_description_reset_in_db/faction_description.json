Their history has left them terribly reserved and shy, however, and they contact other species with great hesitation.

Their joy of crafting and building and their scientific and industrial excellence is only equaled by their reputation as troublemakers, adventurers, and daredevil explorers. While certain genetic markers and a deep, abiding love for explosives indicate a kinship with the Sophons, their brazen attitude, love of physical danger and criminal tendencies indicate nevertheless that they are a markedly different species. Often found as weapons experts, bounty hunters, and mercenaries, relationships with the Mavros may be frustrating, but never dull.",

As they moved from protecting or conquering a tree to a tribe to a village, the society realized that its somewhat belligerent tendencies had to be channeled. Over time they developed a martial art that they call \"Mardamari\", unique in the galaxy for the number of limbs required to execute it. They are led by Gunga, spiritual and martial leaders who have the responsibility for moral and physical education. Jolly and gregarious in daily life, they are deadly serious in questions of combat and honor.",
